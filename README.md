# Clipboard-Landing-Page-Master

This is a solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9).

The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

My Process:

I started by adding some basic formatting, most of the colors are provided in the Style Guide, which can be found at the top of my CSS file.
Currently focusing on the Desktop version.
